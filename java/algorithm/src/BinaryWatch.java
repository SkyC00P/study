/**
 * A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11),
 * and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59)
 *
 * Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.
 *
 * The order of output does not matter.
 * The hour must not contain a leading zero, for example "01:00" is not valid, it should be "1:00".
 * The minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero, for example "10:2" is not valid, it should be "10:02"
 *
 * Given a non-negative integer n which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on,
 * return all possible times the watch could represent
